## Synopsis

This app is the "FunFacts" Treehouse Android application. This app displays random fun facts that are hard-coded into the program when the user taps a button. Creating it was a great introductory lesson about the Android framework.

## Motivation

Fun way to learn about Android application development with Android Studio as a part of Code Oregon 1.0, a state partnership between Oregon and Team Treehouse to teach programming skills to Oregon citizens.

## Installation

Recommend importing into Android Studio and doing some testing before deploying.
